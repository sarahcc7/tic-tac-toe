# Tic Tac Toe Challenge

Create a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game.

## Setup

- [ ] Create a new repo (or fork this one)
- [ ] If you created a new repo, clone this repository and change the remote to your new one.
- [ ] Edit the [index.html](./index.html) file, to create the board markup
- [ ] Edit the [index.js](./index.js) file to play the game

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The board is empty at the start of the game, and it's shown that it's player 1's turn somewhere
- [ ] Clicking anywhere in the section will mark an x for player 1, then it's shown that it's player 2's turn
- [ ] This will continue until someone has won. If you live under a rock, you can win with any of the same side in a row of 3.
